# üí± Currency Converter (FastAPI)

A **currency conversion API** built with **FastAPI** and **Python**, using live BTC-based exchange rates from the **Binance public API**.  
It computes USD/EUR/GBP cross rates via BTC as an intermediary and caches results to avoid redundant API calls.

Note: Binance‚Äôs GBP exchange rates are systematically incorrect, which causes inaccurate results in every conversion that includes GBP.

üîç Endpoints
/convert

Converts an amount between USD, EUR, and GBP.

Example:

GET /convert?ccy_from=USD&ccy_to=EUR&quantity=100


Response:

{
  "quantity": 91.58,
  "ccy": "EUR"
}

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on GBP Data

The GBP quotes provided by Binance are consistently inaccurate,
which causes incorrect conversion values for any pairs involving GBP.
The application deliberately uses Binance‚Äôs raw data, as specified in the assignment,
without applying external corrections.
